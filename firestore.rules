/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Wallet XChanger.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and transactions,
 * while allowing public read access to exchange rates.  Write access to exchange rates is not granted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /exchange_rates/{exchangeRateId}: Stores exchange rates. Public read access, no write access.
 * - /users/{userId}/transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transactions for each user. Only the user can read/write their own transactions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - Exchange rates are publicly readable but not writable, allowing for easy access without authentication.
 * - The rules leverage path-based ownership to simplify authorization and avoid costly `get()` calls.
 * - No admin roles are defined, thus admin-level privileges are not granted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Transaction` entity includes a `userId` field that mirrors the parent `/users/{userId}` path,
 *   ensuring the transaction belongs to the correct user. This enables path-based ownership checks.
